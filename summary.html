            <h1>UW Grade Distribution & GPA Findings Report</h1>
            <p><em>by Nicholas Xu, Yuheng Zhong, Chloe Chen, Keyan Ding</em></p>
            <br>
            <p>We are glad to see you here! As fellow UW students, one of the most frustrating situations to find yourself in is a course where all of your friends are in the "easier section". For most of us, it feels like this happens all of the time. This data visualization study hopes to dismystify such perception.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Lower division? Might be thougher!</h2>
            <p>With chart “GPA by college,” we can easily see that there is a strong correlation between average class
            GPA and the number of 4.0 given. The more 4.0 in a class, the higher average GPA.</p>
            <br><br>
            <img src = "bycollege.jpg" alt = "Pasted Graphic 1" width = "750" heigh = "1000">
            <br><br>
            <p>One striking finding from this graph is that we see <strong>systematic harsher grading in lower divisions ,
            larger classes</strong>. For example, the lowest average GPA from the College of Engineering is <i>CSE 142</i> and <i>CSE 143</i>,
            which happens to be the most enrolled and lowest GPA class (~18,000 students, GPA 2.7). We see a similar trend in Foster
            School of Business where the toughest class and most popular class happen to be <i>ACCTG 225, ACCTG 215, QMETH 201</i>.</p>
            <br><br>

            
            <h2>Why make it harder?</h2>
            <p> When a course found consistently having high failing/withdrawl rate,
            the department will take actions to revise prerequisites or replace instructors. 
            <br><br>
            <img src = "fail.jpg" alt = "Image for fail / A analysis" width = "750" heigh = "1000">
            <br>
            From the two graphs,
            we can see that the <strong>fail/withdrawal rate </strong> are <strong>higher</strong> for <strong>upper level classes
            (300-400) as well as prerequisites </strong> for competitive major. We speculate that they intentionally serve to maintain the rigor of those compeitive majors such as <strong>Business, CSE, Biology, etc.</strong> On the other hand, many upper level classes also have high fail/withdrawal rate, which is due to class size.

            <br><br><br>
            <h2>Want to get an easy 4.0? Consider taking higher level classes.</h2>


            <p>Furthermore, We find a consistent trend in the percentage of student receiving A.
            More students from upper division classes and entry-level classes receive A (3.9/4.0) than others. The 
            learning goals of these classes might explain this trend. 
            <br><br>
            In some entry level classes,
            the objective of class is to provide a breadth or general education to freshman and sophomores without
            requiring previous knowledge background. As a result of that, these lower-division courses usually are
            easier to master and achieve a A grade. The high A percentage in some upper-division courses (especially
            500 level) may because of the fact that some of these classes are General Capstone courses. These
            graduation requirement classes usually centered the idea of integrating knowledge to real-life example
            while emphasizing less about grade.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Grade inflation is REAL</h2>
            <p>With “GPA by course” lookup tool, we can quickly query a course of interest
            and to learn the grade distribution (% of A, A-, B+, B, etc.) and quarters offered in the past.</p>

            <img src = "dist.jpg" alt = "Pasted Graphic 1" width = "750" heigh = "1000">
            <br><br>
            <p>One interesting thing about this is that we find <strong>some classes do have a considerable
            variation in average GPA, while others don’t.</strong> Another interesting finding is that
            <strong>4.0 is often easier than we might think</strong>. Grades inflation is real.
            For example, in INFO 201 offered in the past few years, we have 1547 students enrolled to 11
            sections, and 50.6% received a grade of 3.9/4.0, and 31.2% received a grade 3.5 and up.<p>
