    <br>
    <p class="lead">We aspire to empower students by fostering transparency behind GPA data.
        This website started as a final project for <em>INFO 201 Data Visualization</em> class and it was awarded best project.
        It provides the average GPA for all the courses offered from Autumn 2010 to
    Autumn 2018 at University of Washington.</p><br>

    <h3 style="color: rgb(209, 102, 30)">A bit of background</h3>
    <p>Lots of students go to sites like ratemyprofessor.com or UW’s own
        course evaluation site to learn more about their courses before they commit.
        Often time they also ask recommendations from friends and peers. However,
        the information they can reach is often made up of single data points and
    thus is limited and subjective.</p>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(209, 102, 30)">Objectives</h3>
    <p>We aim to eliminate the scarcity of course data by providing you with
        visualizations and filters to help you get done your measurement of course
        difficulty. <br><br>In addition, we would love to help you make better decisions at
        course registration, so we cleaned, aggregated, and analyzed course data across
        years to expose you to the most accurate student performance history in your
    courses.</p>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(209, 102, 30)">What questions can be answered?</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, we hope to help you make an accurate assessment of
        course difficulty. We conjectured that the grade/GPA distribution,
        including the distribution/percentage of failure and 4.0 grades, serves
        as a good reflection of the difficulty level. Therefore, say if you want
        to learn about the difficulty of a specific course, you can go to the
        "GPA by course" and "Best & worst class" tabs.
        <br><br>Despite this, we add and make two more dimensions of our GPA data
        available - the average GPA/4.0 GPA by “school” and “department”
        respectively - to get you informed of the trend or outliers of
        difficulties, in terms of grades,  across courses within your concerned
        school or department. If you have a major, great job! They can help you
        plan ahead and register for class wisely as you continue to take many
        upper-level classes; If you don’t have a major yet, no worries! you can
        utilize both as comparison tools to get insights of student performance
        across different schools/departments and then intend for the one that
    best fits you!</p>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(209, 102, 30)">Our data</h3>
    <p>We obtained a set of data from UW public record office by email
        request.The office then gave us a total of 9 files. The data from the
        nine files each represents different information regarding student
        course average GPA distribution, enrollments, course evaluations, and etc.
        We put all the data from 9 file into 1 file - “uw_courses.csv” through R.
        After that, we processed the raw data, and extrapolated the new file which
        is going to be the only file that we will use moving forward to reduce
    complexity. We also ensured that all of our data are FERPA safe.</p>
