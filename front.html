            <p class="lead">This is a set of tools and data that helps you explore the
                history of student performance of courses offered from Autumn 2010 to
            Autumn 2018 at University of Washington.</p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p class="lead">A bit of background</p>
            <p>Lots of students go to sites like ratemyprofessor.com or UW’s own
                course evaluation site to learn more about their courses before they commit.
                Often time they also ask recommendations from friends and peers. However,
                the information they can reach is often made up of single data points and
            thus is limited and subjective.</p>
            <p class="lead"><br>Objectives</p>
            <p>We aim to eliminate the scarcity of course data by providing you with
                visualizations and filters to help you get done your measurement of course
                difficulty. <br><br>In addition, we would love to help you make better decisions at
                course registration, so we cleaned, aggregated, and analyzed course data across
                years to expose you to the most accurate student performance history in your
            courses.</p>
            <p class="lead"><br>What questions can be answered?</p>
            <p>As mentioned above, we hope to help you make an accurate assessment of
                course difficulty. We conjectured that the grade/GPA distribution,
                including the distribution/percentage of failure and 4.0 grades, serves
                as a good reflection of the difficulty level. Therefore, say if you want
                to learn about the difficulty of a specific course, you can go to the
                "GPA by course" and "Best & worst class" tabs.
                <br><br>Despite this, we add and make two more dimensions of our GPA data
                available - the average GPA/4.0 GPA by “school” and “department”
                respectively - to get you informed of the trend or outliers of
                difficulties, in terms of grades,  across courses within your concerned
                school or department. If you have a major, great job! They can help you
                plan ahead and register for class wisely as you continue to take many
                upper-level classes; If you don’t have a major yet, no worries! you can
                utilize both as comparison tools to get insights of student performance
                across different schools/departments and then intend for the one that
            best fits you!</p>
            <p class="lead"><br>Our data</p>
            <p>We obtained a set of data from UW public record office by email
                request.The office then gave us a total of 9 files. The data from the
                nine files each represents different information regarding student
                course average GPA distribution, enrollments, course evaluations, and etc.
                We put all the data from 9 file into 1 file - “uw_courses.csv” through R.
                After that, we processed the raw data, and extrapolated the new file which
                is going to be the only file that we will use moving forward to reduce
            complexity. We also ensured that all of our data are FERPA safe.</p>
